# Custom Programming Task: Space Explorer

## Overview
You are tasked with modeling objects in Java to simulate space exploration. This project will familiarize you with Java classes, allowing you to explore core programming concepts. This time, we're embarking on a journey not into the mythical realm but into the vast universe. Your mission is to model space vehicles and celestial bodies.

## Deadline
Complete and submit this task before the next class session.

## Instructions
Refer to the course instructions on how to complete and submit assignments. If unsure, consult the assignments section of the course portal or ask your instructor.

## Preparation
- Review Module 2: Looking Inside Classes, focusing on class design, constructors, getters and setters, and method overloading.
- Read relevant sections from Java documentation or any Java textbook recommended by your instructor.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this task, you will achieve the following learning objectives:
- Design Java classes to model complex systems.
- Implement constructors, getters, and setters in classes.
- Understand and utilize object interactions within Java programming.
- Gain familiarity with the concept of method overloading and its applications.

## Assignment Description

### Universe Modeling
You are to model space vehicles and celestial bodies in Java. Take creative liberty in deciding the attributes and behaviors of these entities. Reflect on what makes sense for a space vehicle (e.g., fuel level, speed, destination) and a celestial body (e.g., type, size, distance from Earth).

#### Space Vehicle Class
1. Create a Java file named `SpaceVehicle.java`.
2. Design a class that includes attributes such as name, fuel level, speed, and destination.
3. Add a constructor method to initialize your space vehicles.
4. Implement getters and setters for each attribute.

#### Celestial Body Class
1. Create a Java file named `CelestialBody.java`.
2. Design a class with appropriate attributes (e.g., name, type, size, distance).
3. Include a constructor to set the initial state of celestial bodies.
4. Provide getters and setters for managing attribute values.

### Object Interaction: Exploring the Universe
Your space vehicles will explore the universe by visiting various celestial bodies. Formulate a method in the Space Vehicle class for traveling, which will take a Celestial Body object as an argument. This method should simulate the travel by adjusting the vehicle's fuel level based on the distance to the destination and updating its current destination to the Celestial Body visited.

### Space Vehicle Showdown: A Friendly Race
Add functionality for two Space Vehicles to engage in a friendly race to a Celestial Body. This will require a method that compares the speeds of two vehicles and determines which one will arrive first based on distance and speed.

### Bonus Task: Variable Shadowing
Explore the concept of variable shadowing in Java by creating a scenario where local variables in methods shadow instance variables. Document how you resolve this issue using the `this` keyword.

## Checklist
- Created a SpaceVehicle class with specified attributes and methods.
- Developed a CelestialBody class with relevant properties.
- Implemented interactions between Space Vehicle and Celestial Bodies through travel methods.
- Added functionality for a space vehicle race to a celestial body.
- Explored and documented the resolution of variable shadowing in the context of your task.

## Submission Guide
Ensure your code is well-commented and adheres to the submission guidelines provided in your course instructions. Package your Java files and any additional documentation into a zip file or use the submission system as specified by your instructor.

## Help
If you encounter any difficulties, first consult with your classmates. Should problems persist, please open a new issue in the course's issue tracker with a detailed description of your problem.
